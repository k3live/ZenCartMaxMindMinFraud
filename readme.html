</font></p>
<p align="left"><u><font size="+1">Overview</font></u><br />
1. This has been tested on ZenCart 1.37, your mileage on earlier versions may vary.<br />
2. This addon will allow the store owner to query the MaxMind server to identify and place a risk score on transactions.<br />
3. You MUST have an account with MaxMind to use this addon! You may get a test license with 1000 queries at:<br />

  <strong>Fraudster techniques becoming more   advanced</strong><br />
Techniques used in online card-not-present fraud are becoming   more and more sophisticated. Traditional fraud screening tools can only   determine if a credit card is legitimate or if the user-entered account   information matches those on record. Today, fraudsters can obtain personal   credit card information, pose as the legitimate card holder, and bypass standard   fraud checks. </p>
<p><strong>Looking at fraud from a different angle</strong><br />
At   MaxMind, we approach fraud screening in a different way. We examine an online   transaction from various angles. Our tools are not geared towards verifying the   authenticity of the credit card details used for the purchase, but rather,   identifying if the purchaser is the legitimate card holder. Through our   analysis, we have been able to identify traits and patterns that are associated   with fraudulent orders. By asking the right questions, we can provide e-commerce   businesses with the necessary information to detect fraudulent orders before the   payment is processed. </p>
<p>5. This is what you should see once installed: </p>

<p align="left"><u><font size="+1">Installation</font></u><br />
With Zen Magic only one file needs to be replaced IF you want credit card orders to auto-process when the order is placed:<br />
includes/modules/pages/checkout_process/header.php</p>
<p align="left">If you want to use the credit card issuer (BIN) name and phone number fraud scoring, or if you use the default credit card module and do not store credit card numbers on the server (you e-mail the middle numbers), you will need to replace:<br />
  includes/modules/payment/cc.php<br />
(This needs to be done to change which numbers stay on the server and which get e-mailed to you, we need the first 6 numbers to pass on to MaxMind)</p>
<p align="left">All other files are added and used with Zen Magic:<br />
  admin/maxmind_orders.php<br />
admin/maxmind_update.php<br />
admin/images/flags/*.*
